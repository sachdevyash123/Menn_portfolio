                <p>Hi, I'm Yash! I'm a Computer Engineering student with a strong passion for front-end development and the MERN stack. Currently, I'm honing my skills in JavaScript, ReactJS, Express.js, and Node.js, and have completed several projects that showcase my abilities in these areas. I enjoy creating seamless, user-focused interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also developing robust back-end functionality.

<br/>I'm also interning at BrainSquare Technologies, gaining practical experience in a professional setting, which has been instrumental in refining my problem-solving skills and deepening my understanding of real-world applications.

<br/><br/>Thanks for visiting my portfolioâ€”feel free to explore my projects and reach out!</p>
